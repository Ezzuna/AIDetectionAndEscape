# AIDetectionAndEscape

Basic AI that wanders around a scene until it sees danger. Danger can be in the form of the player holding a gun or another AI evacuating. 
They will run to an invisible extrraction point and be evacuated(destroyed).

Press 1 to equip a weapon as player and become dangerous. Press 2 to alert all civilians.

Meant as a basic proof of concept for AI danger detection and could be expanded to fit a style of detection similar to games such as Payday 1/2.
